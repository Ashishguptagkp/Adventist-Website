                Women's Department
              </h1>
              The Department of Women's Ministries exists to uphold, encourage, and challenge Adventist women in their pilgrimage as disciples of Jesus Christ and members of His world church.
              Vision: Women empowered and nurtured to fulfill their God-given potential.
              
              Mission: Our mission is in the larger sense common to all Christians—that of uplifting Christ in the Church and in the world. But more specifically, we are called to:
              
              Nurture—Reach Up to God 
              Empower—Reach In with God 
              Outreach—Reach Out with God 
              
              Women's Ministries is a place to address the spiritual, emotional, physical, and social needs of women in the church. Women's Ministries encourages women to improve their potential for participation in the mission of the church. It is a support system for hurting women—whether they are suffering from divorce, abuse or simply loneliness. It encourages women to become involved in all areas of ministry in their church, their community, and in their home. It mentors young women so that they may find joy in the Lord. Women's Ministries recognizes that women have many Gifts of the Spirit, and it attempts to help women discover and use these gifts to the glory of God.

                Youth Department
              </h1>
              The primary focus of our youth ministry is the salvation of our youth. Recognizing increased at-risk behavior, falling moral standards, and rising youth apostasy rates, we aim to bring young hearts closer to Christ. Through innovative digital approaches, we seek to engage, inspire, and lead them on a path of faith and discipleship¹.

              Building upon the legacy of our predecessors, we look beyond the obvious. As we approach the second coming of Jesus Christ, our digital transformation strategy involves:
              
              <br>
              Digital Animation Evangelism (DAE)- Created as a means to unite Seventh-day Adventist youth, DAE leverages animation to share the gospel. Talented young animators collaborate to produce captivating content that draws souls to Christ. Whether through short films, social media, or interactive websites, DAE bridges the gap between technology and evangelism
              
              Literature Distribution- In the spirit of the early years, where youth distributed millions of pieces of literature, we continue to use digital channels for literature distribution. E-books,books  and online devotions.
             
              
              The Global Youth Vision unites local churches with global objectives. As part of this vision, we pass on the baton of leadership, making every local church a true home for youth.

                Sabbath School & Personal Ministry
              </h1>
              Sabbath School is an essential part of Seventh-day Adventist worship and study. It provides a platform for members to engage in Bible study, explore God’s Word, and deepen their faith. The lessons cover various topics related to the cosmic conflict between good and evil, emphasizing spiritual growth and understanding.

              The current quarterly lesson, titled “The Great Controversy,” delves into themes such as the ongoing battle between righteousness and sin, the role of Jesus as our High Priest, the enduring power of God’s Word, and the hope we find in salvation. Each week, participants study a specific lesson, memorize key verses, and discuss the material in small groups.
              
              Remember, Sabbath School encourages fellowship, learning, and spiritual reflection. If you’re interested, you can find detailed lesson materials, videos, and additional resources on the Sabbath School website. 
              Feel free to explore and engage in meaningful study with fellow believers!

                Children Ministry Department
              </h1>
              Children’s Ministry aims to develop the faith of children from birth through age 14, leading them into union with the Church.
              It seeks to provide multiple ministries that will:
              Lead children to Jesus.
              Disciple them in their daily walk with Him.
              Cooperate with other departments, including Sabbath School, to provide religious education to children.
              Mission and Approach:
              Children’s Ministries fulfills its mission by developing a variety of grace-oriented ministries for children. These ministries are:
              Inclusive: Welcoming all children regardless of background or abilities.
              Service-Oriented: Encouraging children to serve others.
              Leadership-Building: Equipping children with leadership skills.
              Safe: Providing a secure environment.
              Evangelistic: Sharing the gospel with children.
              Importance of Early Training:
              Ellen G. White, a prominent Adventist author, emphasized the significance of early training for children:
              “The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of life have more to do with forming their character than all they learn in future years.”
              “Children are the most susceptible to the teachings of the gospel; their hearts are open to divine influences.”
              “Very young children may have correct views of their state as sinners and of salvation through Christ.”
              Encouragement to Allow Children to Come to Jesus:
              Jesus Himself encouraged His followers not to hinder children from coming to Him.
              The church and parents should allow children to experience spiritual growth and education.
              Remember, Children’s Ministries plays a vital role in nurturing young hearts and minds within the Seventh-day Adventist Church community.
